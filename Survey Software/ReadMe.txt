1.0	OVERVIEW 
===========================================
The SURVEY program and appendix were originally included with the first edition
of "Sampling: Design and Analysis" for simulating the results of sample surveys.
In the years since the first edition published traditional statistical software
packages such as SAS have developed far more powerful capabilities for performing
surveys. However, for those users who prefer to use SURVEY program we have made
it available as a download for the second edition and have updated the appendix
from the text for using the software. The program, the appendix, computer code
for the software, and an SAS file for reading SURVEY program output in SAS are
available in this download.
